# Duck pond simulation app

This is a simulation game called **SimUDuck** that can show a large variety of duck species swimming and making quacking sounds. Initially the 
system contains one Duck superclass from which all other duck types inherit. Afterwards we will add new duck species and new things that these ducks
can do (for example *fly*) and we will see the problems that arise and how to fix them using patterns.

## STRATEGY pattern

This is a great example where the Strategy pattern is used to rework the design of the SimUDuck app.
